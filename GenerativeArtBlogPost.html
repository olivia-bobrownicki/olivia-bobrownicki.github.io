    <h1>The Artistic Origin</h1>
    <p>This Valentine's Day, I was tasked with contributing to a Valentine's Day installation at Barnard College. 
      Each artist was asked to program an Arduino ESP32 board.
      We displayed our ESP32s in hanging envelopes for students in the Computer Science lounge to see on Valentine's day. </p>

    <p>My artistic vision was strongly shaped by the Valentine's Day installation date.
    I wanted viewers to connect with my piece through the cultural lens of Valentine's Day. 
    The installation itself was destined to be displayed in a hanging envelope, which fit well with the Valentine's Day theme. 
    I leaned into this exterior design element to create a cohesive exterior-interior viewing experience;
    as the viewer approaches the physical letter encasing my ESP32 display, their expectations are fulfilled when the ESP32 presents them with the text of a letter.
    But, on a day about celebrating love, I wanted to emphasize an alternative perspective...sending letters as a way of conveying love lost.
